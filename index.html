                  contact.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Cover your mouth and nose with a bent elbow or tissue whrn you
                  cough or sneeze. Dispose of used eissues immediately and clean

                <li>Make sure your mask covers your nose, mouth and chin.</li>
                <li>
                  Clean yor hands before you put your mask on, before and after
                  you take it off, and after you touch it at any time.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When you take off your mask, store it in a clean plastic bag,
                  and every day either wash it if it's a fabric mask or dispose
                  of it in a trash bin if it's a medical mask.
                </li>

              <p>
                Masks should be used as part of a comprehensive strategy of
                measures to suppress transmission and save lives; the use of a
                mask alone is not sufficient to provide an adequate level of
                protection against COVID-19.
              </p>
              <p>
                Make wearing a mask a normal part of being around other people.
                The appropriate use, storage and cleaning or disposal of masks
                are essential to make them as effective as possible..

                <li>
                  Meet people outside. Outdoor gatherings are safer than indoor
                  ones, particularly if indoor spaces are small and without
                  outdoor air coming in.

                    <li>
                      Open a window to increase the amount of natural
                      ventilation when indoors.

              <p>
                Clean shoes and put them in a well-ventilated place. Wash hands
                immediately afterwards
              </p>
              <p>
                Wash clothes or air them in a well-ventilated place for at least
                one day to clear away dirt and germs.

                  Know the full range of symptoms of COVID-19. The most common

                  provider or hotline for advice. Have someone bring you
                  supplies. If you need to leave your house or have someone near
                  you, wear a properly fitted mask to avoid infecting others.

                Contact a healthcare provider right away after a positive test
